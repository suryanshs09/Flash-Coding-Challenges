# Matrix Reloaded

## Problem Statement

This is your Computational Statistics class and you teacher has given you a question to solve. You have a square matrix and you need to find the product of the sum of the absolute values of both the digonals of that matrix.

## Input

- The first line of input contains a single integer `T` denoting the number of test cases. 
  
The description of T test cases follows.

- The first line of each test case contains a single integer `N` denoting the size of square matrix.
- The i-th line of the next N lines contains N space-separated integers A<sub>i0</sub>, A<sub>i1</sub>, ... A<sub>iN</sub> denoting the elements of the i-th row of the matrix.
 
## Output

- For each test case, output a single integer that will be the solution according to the question.

_**Note:** the output of each test case are seperated by new line._
 
## Constraints

- 1 &le; T &le; 100
- 2 &le; N &le; 20
- -1000 \< A<sub>00</sub>, A<sub>01</sub>, ... A<sub>ij</sub> \< 1000 \(where, 0 &le; i, j \< N\)
