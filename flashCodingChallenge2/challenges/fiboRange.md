# fiboRange

## Problem Statement

Given a start `S` and end `E` as input print all the fibonacci series numbers which lie within the range (S, E).
 If no number exists between the range print `No Data!`. 

_**Note:** Do not include S or E if they exists in fibonacci series. That is, only numbers \> S and numbers \< E that are part of the series must be considered._

## Input

- The first line of input contains a single integer `T` denoting the number of test cases. 
  
The description of T test cases follows.

- The first line and only of each test case contains two space-separated integers `S` denoting the start of range and `E` denoting end of range.
 
## Output

- For each test case, output space-separated fibonacci series number which are greater than `S` and less than `E`.
- if no number exists between `S` and `E` then print `No Data!`.

_**Note:** the output of each test case are seperated by new line._
 
## Constraints

- 1 &le; T &le; 10<sup>4</sup>
- 1 &le; S, E &le; 10<sup>9</sup>
- S \< E
