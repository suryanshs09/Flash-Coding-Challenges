# layer_Numbers

## Problem Statement

By taking a number `n` as input, you need to create a square-shaped layered pattern of size `n x n` as the output of this challenge.
 Each layer of the pattern will conatin the layer number starting from the largest number in the outermost layer to 1 in the innermost layer.
  
_**Note:** if n is even then there is no center element but if n is odd then there will be a center element so print it as `0`._

## Input

- The first line of input contains a single integer `n` denoting the size of the pattern.
 For example, if n=5, then pattern will be of size `5 x 5`.

## Output

- the desired pattern.
 
## Constraints

- 1 &le; `n` &le; 500
